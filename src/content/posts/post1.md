# Hello There!

I go by **Xiffy**, and welcome to my personal take of the internet and the stuff I consume.

For a long time, I've wanted a space that is entirely my own ,somewhere to catalog the things I love, the games that consume my free time, and whatever random thoughts are living rent-free in my head. Social media is great for quick updates but sometimes you just need more room to breathe, write and explain exactly why that one lore theory that you saw on r/GenshinLore makes total sense.

So, here we are. This blog is going to be my digital journal for gaming, hobbies, and everything in between.

## The Digital Rabbit Hole

If you know me through discord, you know that I spend a significant amount of time on my hobbies. I love games that scratch that itch of making you feel empty when you hit the game credits. I love digging into the mechanics, maximizing builds, and getting lost in the lore.

Currently, I am residing deep inside the Gacha rabbit hole. It’s a love-hate relationship with RNG, but the worlds these developers create keep me coming back.

:::note[MY ROTATION]
Here is what I am currently playing , some of them are casually:
* **Genshin Impact:** This is my main game. If I'm not online, I'm probably thinking about artifact stats or lore.
* **Wuthering Waves:** Loved the combat mechanics here but a love-hate relationship with the lore but now I am moving towards playing the game on and off.
* **Honkai: Star Rail:** Playing casually and it is usually for when I want turn-based strategy (and pain) and lay back on my couch.
* **Zenless Zone Zero:** Same as above. Underrated in terms of game quality , both in combat and out of combat (iykyk).

I also play **Punishing Gray Raven** for its combat and lovely community.

### It's Not Just Gacha
While I spend a lot of time grinding dailies and saving pulls for new characters (well its only about an hour at max when you hit the endgame), I need a break from the anime aesthetic sometimes. I am a massive fan of **Indie games** and, specifically, **Horror games**.

There is something about the adrenaline of a good horror game—the scarier, the better. Expect to see some posts here about my experiences (and probably some regrets) playing through the scariest titles I can find.

## Off The Screen

When I finally put the controller down or tab out of the game, I'm usually shouting at a TV screen. I am a massive football fan—**Visca el Barça!**

I also consume a healthy amount of media. I love myself a good **spy thriller**, the imagination of **sci-fi**, and the grit of a solid **crime drama**. I try to read a little when I can, though my backlog of books is starting to rival my backlog of games.

## What to Expect Here

I want this blog to be a mix of helpful content and personal rambling. In the future, you can expect:
1.  **Game Reviews & Impressions:** My honest thoughts on the latest updates or new indie finds.
2.  **Lore Theories:** Deep dives into the stories of the games I play.
3.  **Wacky Stuff I find interesting:** Sharing some unique stuff I find online and my takes and impressions on them mostly based on the games or tech I consume.
4.  **Personal Updates:** Life outside the screen.

## Let's Connect

I am always down to co-op, discuss the latest banners, or just talk about games. I am active on both Discord and Twitter, so feel free to say hi.
