# The Philosophy Behind the List

Welcome to the definitive breakdown of how I rank characters in this game. 

Tier lists are inherently contentious. Everyone has that one character they main who they believe is underrated, or a popular character they think is overhyped. This list is a culmination of three things:
1.  **General User Consensus:** What the community at large is succeeding with.
2.  **Public Data:** Cross-referencing usage rates and clear times from other popular analytics and content-creator tier lists.
3.  **My Personal Experience:** How these characters actually *feel* to play in the current economy of the game.

The goal here isn't just to rank "Damage Per Second" (DPS) in a vacuum. It is to represent a character's **Pull Value** alongside their **Relative Strength** in their respective best game modes.

:::caution[DISCLAIMER]
This tier list reflects a lot of how **I** view characters and their current state. While I look at data, a lot of "feel" goes into these rankings. You are free to disagree with placements, and I do not intend to offend anyone who loves a character ranked lower than expected.

If there is one thing Gacha games love, it's a good tier list. But a list without context is just a random assortment of PNGs.

This post serves as the **official documentation** for my tier list. Whether you are here to validate your main or decide who to pull next, understanding the criteria behind these rankings is crucial. This isn't just about who hits the biggest number—it's about value, flexibility, and cost.

## 1. Investment Assumptions

To keep the comparison fair and realistic for the average player (or light spender), I adhere to a strict standard for character investment. Ranking a C6 5-star against a C0 4-star doesn't help anyone make informed decisions.

:::important[THE STANDARD]
* **5-Star Characters:** Evaluated at **C0** (Constellation 0).
* **4-Star Characters:** Evaluated at **C6** (Constellation 6).
:::

**Why C6 for 4-stars?** Over time, you *will* naturally accumulate copies of 4-star characters. Their kit is often incomplete or significantly weaker at C0, but at C6, many become powerhouses that rival 5-stars.

**Why C0 for 5-stars?** This represents the baseline cost. A character should function completely out of the box.

In terms of investment , I am considering 25 useful substats for the build. While for weapon, I am considering both sigs and F2P weapons , if a character has lot of options for weapons , there would be relevant tags signifying that and vice-versa.

## 2. Ranking Criteria: Strength vs. Value

This tier list is a hybrid. It represents two distinct metrics combined into one position:
1.  **Relative Strength:** How fast can they clear the Abyss? How big are their numbers?
2.  **Pull Value:** Is this character "future-proof"? Do they fit into many teams, or are they stuck in one niche?

A character might deal insane damage (High Strength) but require a very specific, expensive team to work (Lower Pull Value). Both factors weigh into the final placement.

## 3. The Role System

I categorize characters into three distinct buckets to avoid comparing apples to oranges. You shouldn't compare a Main DPS to a Healer.

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Main DPS** | The on-field carry. The character you build the team around, who eats up the most field time and deals the majority of the damage. |
| **Sub-DPS** | The off-field damage dealer. They swap in, drop their skills/bursts, and swap out, continuing to deal damage while your Main DPS is active. |
| **Support** | The backbone of the team. This includes Buffers, Healers, Shielders, and anyone whose primary job is to amplify the team's performance rather than deal raw damage. |

## 4. Decoding the Tags

You will notice colored tags under each character card. These aren't just flavor text; they are a quick-glance guide to a character's strengths, weaknesses, and playstyle.

### <span class="text-green-500">The Advantages (Green)</span>
These tags highlight strong utility that adds immense value to an account.
* **BUFF:** The character provides stat amplification (ATK, EM, DMG Bonus, etc.).
* **SHIELD:** Provides interruption resistance and damage mitigation via shields.
* **HEAL:** Keeps the team alive.
* **CC (Crowd Control):** Groups enemies together, making AOE damage significantly easier.
* **DEBUFF:** Weakens enemies, usually through Resistance Shred (VV, Deepwood) or Defense Ignore.

### <span class="text-red-500">The Caveats (Red)</span>
These tags represent significant drawbacks or "conditions" you must meet.
* **ULT:** This character is "Burst reliant." Most of their damage or utility is locked behind their Ultimate. If you don't have enough Energy Recharge, they feel clunky and useless.
* **PARTNER:** The "parasitic" carry. This character struggles alone and *needs* a specific partner to function (e.g., a specific battery or reaction enabler). Their potential is locked until paired correctly.

### <span class="text-gray-400">Combat Scenarios (White)</span>
These describe where the character excels regarding enemy count.
* **ST (Single Target):** Boss killers. They focus massive damage on one foe but struggle against mobs.
* **AOE (Area of Effect):** Mob sweepers. They excel at hitting 3+ enemies simultaneously.
* **CLEAVE:** The middle ground. They have a range larger than single-target (like a Claymore swing or small cylinder) but don't hit the entire room like true AOE.

### <span class="text-orange-400">Situational (Orange)</span>
* **C0:** This tag is exclusive to **4-Star characters**. It warns you that this specific unit is significantly weaker at low constellations. While I rank 4-stars at C6, if you see this tag, know that they might not be worth building until you get more copies.
* **INVEST:** This tag is exclusive for those characters that scale aggressively with vertical investment. While they are usable at a baseline, their true potential (and the reason for their high ranking) is often locked behind having their Signature Weapon, highly optimized Artifacts, or a specific Premium Team. Without these resources, they may feel underwhelming compared to cheaper alternatives.

## What's Next?

Now that we have established the ground rules, the actual rankings will make much more sense.

In the next post, I will break down the **Meta Significance** of the current patch. We will talk about the gap between tiers and how they impact the tier list, why certain elements are dominating the meta right now, and justify some of the more controversial placements on the list.
