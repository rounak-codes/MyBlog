        <p>Diluc has aged gracefully. While he isn't the top DPS anymore, his access to Plunge setups with Xianyun has revitalized his kit.</p>
        <p>He feels clunky without investment, but when optimized, he is a solid comfortable pick for consistent Pyro damage. If you can manage
        to learn advanced techniques such as footstool and dragonstrike , he becomes quite strong and even more fun to play.
        As he has one of the highest plunge attack scalings , he scales extremely well in scenarios where he can abuse plunges and dragonstrikes.</p>

    furina: `
        <p>Absolutely broken. She fits into almost every team and provides a massive damage buff.</p>
        <p>The only downside is needing a team-wide healer, but the payoff is worth it.</p>
